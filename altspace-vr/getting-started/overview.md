# Getting started with AltspaceVR

Welcome to the AltspaceVR developer forums! Explore the different ways you can add content to AltspaceVR in the following sections.

## Mixed Reality Extension (MRE) SDK

The MRE SDK is the new SDK for building AltspaceVR extensions using Node.JS. To get started:

1. Install AltspaceVR (from Steam or Oculus Store), create an AltspaceVR account, and familiarize yourself with the app.
2. [Install Git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. Go to the [MRE SDK Samples repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples) and follow the step-by-step instructions to build and run a sample

You can also:

* Join the [MRE SDK Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/xyBcQec) to chat with other MRE developers.
* [Watch the Building Tic-Tac-Toe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHrdK9JSXI&ab_channel=AltspaceVR)
* Learn how to edit and build MREs with [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk#using-visual-studio-code)
* Browse the [Hello World source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples/tree/master/samples/hello-world)
* Attend our [weekly developer meetups in AltspaceVR](https://account.altvr.com/channels/sdk)

More resources coming soon!

## World Editor

Inside AltspaceVR, you can use our built-in world editor in your home space. This is the easiest way to start modifying your space. Select the World Editor button, bottom right, when you are in your home space. See our [Get Started With World Building page](../world-building/world-building-getting-started.md). With the World Editor, you can place 3d objects, teleporters and extensions (MREs), and change the world skybox.

If you join the [Early Access program](../world-building/early-access.md), you can create more worlds on the [AltspaceVR My Worlds page](https://account.altvr.com/users/sign_in).

There's also a [wonderful video by Karnivore23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8xgR3cDMjk&ab_channel=MarkGill) that covers the end-to-end process of building worlds, including the website, the world editor, and the Unity uploader.

## Unity Uploader

We offer a Unity uploader for both worlds and custom kits. This feature is early in development. To learn more, please join the [World Builders Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/Kp59Frb) to chat, or read about it on the [World Building help pages](../world-building/getting-help.md).

If you have legacy Unity 2018 kits or templates to update to Unity 2019.2, check out the [Upgrade Guide](https://developer.altvr.com/upgrade-2019-2/).

## Integrating the MRE SDK into your own app

If you've made your own app or game in Unity3D and want to run MREs inside your app, look at the [MRE Unity Client Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-unity) repository.
