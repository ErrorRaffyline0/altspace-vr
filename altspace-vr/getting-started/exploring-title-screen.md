# Exploring the Title Screen

The AltspaceVR Title Screen is your primary starting point for exploring the platform. From here, you can do things like login, explore the Main Menu, enter an event with a code, customize your avatar, and more. Below is an overview of the Title Screen and its functions. 

## Tutorial Features & login 

If it's your first time launching AltspaceVR, you'll start your journey as a guest user. This is a temporary identity that is granted to allow you to explore at your own pace before logging in to your AltspaceVR account. For new VR users that want to practice the basics before jumping into the action, try out our [tutorials](../tutorials/host-tools-overview.md). If you feel comfortable jumping directly into AltspaceVR, you can skip the tutorial and sign in.

As a guest you can also explore the Main Menu and view the events calendar, but you can't yet enter events. Account sign-in is required to navigate beyond the Title Screen. To continue, log in to your AltspaceVR account by selecting the **Sign In** option.

If your AltspaceVR account is linked to your Microsoft Account, select the **Sign-in with Microsoft** option. If you don't yet have a Microsoft-linked account, select the **Sign-in with AltspaceVR** option. You can find step-by-step account linking instructions here: [Linking Your Microsoft Account](linking-microsoft-account.md).

## Destinations 

The green **Destinations** button on the left is where you'll find things like AltspaceVR Hubs, your Homespace, upcoming Spotlight Events, any events you have recently attended. You'll also find events that your friends may currently be in. The **Destinations** panel makes navigating to key places quick and simple.

## Event Code 

In AltspaceVR Event Codes are alphanumerical codes that allow for streamlined event entry. You can find an Event Code by using the **Share** button on the event page in VR. You can also locate it just above the social-share icons in the event page on [altvr.com](https://altvr.com).

If you have the code for the event you’d like to attend, enter it into the Title Screen and teleport directly to your destination without searching for the event in your Menu. This makes it easy to launch AltspaceVR and head directly into an event.

## Other Functions 

The final few functions available in the Title Screen are **Account** **Main Menu** and **Exit**. These options mimic the ones found in your radial HUD menu when you are in Events, Hubs, Worlds, or your Homespace. 

The **Account** section gives you several options related to your AltspaceVR account. Here you can review your credentials, connect your AltspaceVR account to a Microsoft Account (or AAD for enterprise users), switch to another account, or sign out of your current account.

The **Main Menu** option in the Title Screen is exactly the same as the Main Menu that you access using your radial HUD elsewhere. Here, you can browse through the tabs for the following features:

* Discovering Hubs
* Exploring the events calendar
* Browsing worlds
* Managing your friends list
* Viewing your account details
* Accessing your settings.

The **Exit** button is useful for closing the AltspaceVR app. By selecting this option, you're choosing to shut down AltspaceVR entirely. Once you confirm the exit dialogue, the app will close itself automatically.
