# Exploring the Title Screen

The AltspaceVR Title Screen is the primary starting point from which to explore the platform. From here you can do things like login, explore the Main Menu, enter an event with a code, customize your avatar, and more. Here is an overview of the Title Screen and its functions: 

## Tutorial Features & Log In 

If it is your first time launching AltspaceVR, you will begin your journey as a guest user. This is a temporary identity that is granted to allow you to explore at your own pace before logging in to your AltspaceVR account. If you're new to VR and want to practice the basics before jumping into the action, try the Tutorial which can be found in the "Tutorial" section on the left. If you feel comfortable and want to proceed directly into AltspaceVR, you can skip the Tutorial and simply sign in.

As a guest you can also explore the Main Menu and view the events calendar, but you cannot yet enter events. Account sign-in is required to navigate beyond the Title Screen. To proceed, log in to your AltspaceVR account by selecting the "Sign In" option.

If your AltspaceVR account is linked to your Microsoft Account, select the "Sign in with Microsoft" option. If you don't yet have a Microsoft-linked account, select the "Sign in with AltspaceVR" option. You can find step-by-step account linking instructions here: [Linking Your Microsoft Account](linking-microsoft-account.md).

## Destinations 

The green "Destinations" button on the left is where you will find things like AltspaceVR Hubs, your Homespace, upcoming Spotlight Events, any events you have recently attended, and also events that your friends may currently be in. The "Destinations" panel makes navigating to key places quick and simple.

## Event Code 

In AltspaceVR Event Codes are simple alphanumerical codes that allow for streamlined event entry. You can find an Event Code by using the "Share" button on the event page in VR, or locating it just above the social-share icons in the event page on altvr.com.

If you have the code for the event you’d like to attend, you can input it into the Title Screen and teleport directly to your destination without searching for the event in your Menu. This makes it easy to launch AltspaceVR and head directly into an event.

## Additional Functions 

The final few functions available in the Title Screen are "Account" "Main Menu" and "Exit". These options mimic those that are found in your radial HUD menu when you are in Events, Hubs, Worlds, or your Homespace. 

The "Account" section gives you several options related to your AltspaceVR account. Here you can review your credentials, connect your AltspaceVR account to a Microsoft Account (or AAD for enterprise users), switch to another account, or sign out of your current account.

The "Main Menu" option in the Title Screen is exactly the same as the Main Menu that you access using your radial HUD elsewhere. Here you can browse by tab: discovering Hubs, exploring the events calendar, browsing worlds, managing your friends list, viewing your account details, and accessing your settings.

The "Exit" button is useful for closing the AltspaceVR app. By selecting this option, you are choosing to shut down AltspaceVR entirely. Once you confirm the exit dialogue, the app will close itself automatically.
