## Oculus Store (from the mobile app)

To install AltspaceVR from the Oculus Store mobile app:

1. Open the Oculus app.
2. [Open AltspaceVR on the Oculus Store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2133027990157329/).
3. Select **Free** to add AltspaceVR to your library. 
4. When the Free button transitions to **Install on Oculus Quest**, select it to queue the app for installation on your device.
5. Once complete, the Install on Oculus Quest button will transition to **Start**. 
6. Select **Start** to launch the application, and then put on your headset to begin!

## Oculus Store (from the Oculus Quest)

If you're installing from the Oculus Store on the Oculus Quest:

1. Open the toolbar by pressing the **Oculus button** on the **right Touch controller** labeled with the Oculus icon.
2. Select **Navigate** from the toolbar, which will open another toolbar--select **Store** on the second toolbar.
3. Navigate to the AltspaceVR app in the store. You can browse the store or click **Search** in the top-right of the store and enter 'Altspace'.
4. On the AltspaceVR Store page, select the blue **Free** button to get and begin installing the app.
5. If the install doesn't begin immediately, look for an Install button on the page and click it to begin the installation.
6. Once the app is installed, you can select **Open** from the store page to launch it. You can also launch it anytime from your library.

## Troubleshooting

**Microphone permission is toggled off**

AltspaceVR requires your microphone permission to be toggled in the "on" position for users to speak.  If your users have the permission toggled "off" they can still enter, but may experience the following issues:

<!-- Missing image -->
<!-- oculus-permissions-denymicrophone.png -->
	
* User can't speak in AltspaceVR.
* User can speak in other applications.
* Mute button is disabled in the 'muted' position in AltspaceVR.

**AltspaceVR won't launch upon first installation**

* If the AltspaceVR app is open but not launching correctly, exit the app and try again.
* If launch errors continue, fully uninstall the app from the Oculus Quest and then reinstall it again.
* If launch errors continue, open a support ticket with us so that we may assist you further.

**AltspaceVR won't launch after previously sideloading the app**

* Fully uninstall your sideloaded app and attempt to reinstall from the store again.
* If launch errors continue, open a support ticket with us so that we may assist you further.
