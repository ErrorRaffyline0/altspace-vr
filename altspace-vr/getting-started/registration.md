# Registering for AltspaceVR

You can register for AltspaceVR from inside the AltspaceVR app:

1. Start by [downloading AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/getaltspacevr) from your preferred app store or library. 
2. Once you've downloaded and entered AltspaceVR, select **Sign Up** to create an account.
3. After signing up, you'll receive a confirmation email titled "Confirmation instructions" from "AltspaceVR@altvr.com". 

> [!NOTE]
> Gmail has been known to stick these messages in the "Promotions" tab, so if you don't see it in your inbox, be sure to check in there.

4. Open the link provided in the confirmation email to connect your email to your account. Without linking your account, you can't log back in if you accidentally get logged off, log on from another device, or access your account on our website.

If you have any issues signing in make sure, you've [confirmed your email address](https://account.altvr.com/users/confirmation/new) and that [your password is correct](https://account.altvr.com/users/password/new).

## Commonly Asked Questions

**Which name will other users see?**

Your "Display Name" is what other users will see above your avatar. Your "Username" will be displayed in the friends tab of the menu for people who have added you as a friend. Both your Display Name and Username will be visible on your avatar's nametag.

**Does my Display Name have to be unique?**
 
No, users can share the same Display Name. If you'd like to go by "Dave" or "Maria", you can do just that. Your Display Name can also include spaces while the username can't.

**I can't remember my password, how can I reset it?**

You can reset your password [here](https://account.altvr.com/users/password/new).

**How can I change my Username or Display Name?**

If you want to change the Username associated with your account, [send us a ticket](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new). Make sure to include the email associated with your account, your current name, and the username you'd like to use in the future.

If you'd like to change your **Display Name**, log onto altvr.com, click your profile icon top right, User Profile, Edit, and update Display Name.

**My menu is blank and I can't sign up, what can I do?**

If your "You" menu isn't displaying, a restart of AltspaceVR will fix the issue and allow you to sign in. After restarting, if you're still having issues with your menus not displaying correctly, ensure both your VR headset and your 2D monitor are plugged into the same GPU.
