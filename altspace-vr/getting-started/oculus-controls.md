To manage your permissions on the Oculus Quest on a per-app basis from your Oculus library:

1. Navigate to the app in your Oculus library.
2. Select the **three-dot icon** to open the app's menu.
3. Select **permissions** from the drop-down menu that appears.

A 'Permissions' UI will load, which you can toggle on and off for each app.
