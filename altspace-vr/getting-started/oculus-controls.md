## Managing permissions

<!-- Missing image -->

On Oculus Quest, permissions can be managed on a per-app basis from your Oculus library by:

* Navigating to the app in your Oculus library.
* Selecting the dotted icon to open the app's menu.
* Selecting 'permissions' from the drop-down menu that appears.

This will load a 'Permissions' UI that will allow you to toggle on and toggle off permissions on a per-item basis for each app.
