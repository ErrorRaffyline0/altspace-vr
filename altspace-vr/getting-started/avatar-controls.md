# Avatar controls with mouse/keyboard in 2D PC mode

There are 2 different control schemes for 2D PC Mode using a mouse and keyboard in AltspaceVR:
* New PC Controls (Note: new accounts default to the these controls)
* Classic PC Controls

You can switch between New/Classic Controls in: Menu / Settings / Input / Classic PC Controls (toggle off/on)

## New PC controls

While using New PC Controls, you have 2 different modes: Cursor Mode and Look Mode.

**Cursor/Look Toggle:** to toggle between the two modes use the Right Click button on your laptop or mouse.

**Cursor Mode** lets you interact with the menus and you’ll know you are in this mode when you see the AltspaceVR Logo/Menu button at the bottom left of your view:

**Look Mode** lets you look around and is great if you are using a laptop trackpad. You can use Look Mode and the keyboard to look/move at the same time. You’ll know you are in Look Mode if you see this at the bottom left your view:
