# Avatar controls with mouse/keyboard in 2D PC mode

There are two different control schemes for 2D PC Mode using a mouse and keyboard:
* New PC Controls, which is the default for new accounts
* Classic PC Controls

You can switch between New/Classic Controls by going to **Menu > Settings > Input > Classic PC Controls** and toggling the option on or off.

## New PC controls

You have two different modes when using the New PC controls: Cursor Mode and Look Mode. Right-click on your laptop or mouse to use the **Cursor/Look Toggle** to toggle between the two modes.

* **Cursor Mode** lets you interact with the menus. You’ll know you're in Cursor Mode when you see the AltspaceVR Logo/Menu button at the bottom left of your view:

* **Look Mode** lets you look around and is great if you're using a laptop trackpad. You can use Look Mode and the keyboard to look/move at the same time. You’ll know you're in Look Mode if the bottom left your view looks like the screenshot below:
