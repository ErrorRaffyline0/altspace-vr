# Linking your Microsoft account

spaceVR now supports Microsoft Account integration. Microsoft Accounts let you access your favorite Microsoft products and services with just one login. From Office and Windows to Xbox and Minecraft, your Microsoft Account connects you to the files, photos, people, and content you care about most. You can learn more about Microsoft Accounts here. 

Microsoft Account integration in AltspaceVR will roll out in phases. It is currently available for preview and testing as an Early Access* feature. Learn more about the roll out process and Microsoft Account integration on our blog. Below is a step-by-step guide for linking your AltspaceVR account and your Microsoft Account. You should only need to complete the account-linking process once. After that, the system will remember you.

## How To Link Accounts:

To begin you will need a Microsoft Account. You can [create a new Microsoft Account](https://signup.live.com/?lic=1) or use an existing one you already have. At this time you will also need to be opted into the Early Access Program. You can opt in to the Early Access Program anytime by launching AltspaceVR and navigating to the **MAIN MENU> SETTINGS > GENERAL > Participate in Early Access Program**. You may also opt-out of the Early Access Program anytime.

1. Launch AltspaceVR
2. Open your **MAIN MENU > ME > ACCOUNT**
3. Select **LINK** when you're prompted to link your Microsoft Account

    * Choose the one you wish to connect and select **CONTINUE**

Once you have completed the account-linking process, you will see that your account credentials have updated:

    * Enter your unique code and select **NEXT** - the code isn't case sensitive
    * Follow the login instructions presented

## Troubleshooting tips

* If you experience any issues during the account-linking process, try to exit and close AltspaceVR before you re-attempt to connect your accounts.
* If you're in VR mode and are experiencing issues, try unplugging your headset and switching to 2D PC mode (or vice versa).
* If you find yourself unable to reconnect with your Microsoft account, you can still get back into AltspaceVR using your username and password. Just select the "SIGN IN WITH ALTSPACEVR" button.
* Please submit your logs if you run into any issues. Go to MAIN MENU > SETTINGS > SUPPORT > Upload Logs

## Microsoft Account Integration FAQ

**Does this change my AltspaceVR Username or how my details appear in my name tag?**

Linking your AltspaceVR account with your Microsoft Account will not change your publically-displayed username or first name. It will only change your account login credentials (which is private to you.) You will still have full control over how your name, username, and profile picture appear to others in AltspaceVR.

**Can I still switch accounts? This option is no longer under Settings.**

Yes, we've redecorated a bit. You can now manage your account & switch accounts under **Main Menu > Me > Account**

**Do I already have a Microsoft Account?**

It's very possible you already have a Microsoft Account. Do you play Minecraft, game on an Xbox, subscribe to Office 365, or otherwise use any other Microsoft products or services regularly? If so, you probably already have a Microsoft login! You can check to see if your email is already tied to an existing MSA [here](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=13&ct=1610764342&rver=7.0.6738.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fauth%2Fcomplete-signin%3Fru%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccount.microsoft.com%252F%253Frefp%253Dsignedout-index&lc=1033&id=292666&lw=1&fl=easi2).

**Does this mean I need to create a new email address with Outlook?**

No. You can set up a Microsoft Account with a current email address even if it's not hosted with Microsoft. (Ex: G-Mail, Yahoo, etc.)

**Does it cost money?**

Nope! Creating a Microsoft Account is free. Using AltspaceVR is also free. Just remember, your Microsoft Account is linked to other products and services, so you can use it to make purchases of things outside of AltspaceVR, like subscriptions (ex: Office 365) or specialty goods (ex: Minecraft Marketplace), for example.

**What if I am having issues linking my accounts?**

If you're stuck, you can always reach out to our [Help Desk](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new).

**What if I have multiple AltspaceVR accounts?**

Only one AltspsaceVR account can be linked to a Microsoft Account. You will need a separate Microsoft Account for each of the AltspaceVR accounts you wish to connect.

**What if I forget my login details?**

If you're have trouble logging into AltspaceVR after you have connected to your Microsoft Account, reach out to our [Help Desk](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new) for support. If you're having trouble logging into your Microsoft Account see [here](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/when-you-can-t-sign-in-to-your-microsoft-account-475c9b5c-8c25-49f1-9c2d-c64b7072e735) or [here](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-help-keep-your-microsoft-account-safe-and-secure-628538c2-7006-33bb-5ef4-c917657362b9) for a list of troubleshooting tips and resources.

**Do I have to connect to my Microsoft Account?**

Don't worry, you have some time to make the update. We'll be rolling our Microsoft Account integration in phases. However, over time, some of the major new features we're working on will only be available to those who have linked their AltspaceVR account to their Microsoft Account. The reason for this is that these features (like ticketed events, for example) require strong and robust security measures. Read more about this on our [blog](https://altvr.com/microsoft-account-integration).

**What about my privacy and data?**

There is no change to our [Terms of Service](../community/terms-of-service.md) or our [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). Microsoft and AltspaceVR remain committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you remain fully in control when it comes to your data and information. You can learn more about Microsoft's core principles around privacy [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com). You can also request detailed information about the personal data Microsoft has about you related to your Microsoft Account [here](https://www.microsoft.com/concern/privacyrequest-msa). Lastly, remember, if you have an active AltspaceVR account, you can request a copy of your data and/or even request to have your data deleted at anytime.
