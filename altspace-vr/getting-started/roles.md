# Roles in events, worlds, groups, and in AltspaceVR

Roles are like the ‘Credits’ at the end of a movie. There’s the Executive Producer, the Director, the Actors and even crowd control. They are all in charge of something different, all with an important role to play.

## Roles in events

You’ll need to create your event first, then add the roles after. Once you’ve created your event on the website, click the EDIT button, that’ll open up the Contextual Roles ‘Add User’ button. This is where you add AltspaceVR usernames to give out roles for your event.

### Event Creator Roles - When you create an event you automatically get these three Roles:

Admin
- All event management tools via the website. You can Edit, End Event, Set to Draft, Re-Import World, Duplicate Event, Delete Event and Add as Main Event (Public events only).
- Enables World Editor in your event: Environment Clipping, Toggle Flight, Toggle Environment, Edit Mode and Editor Panel.
Presenter - Enables Host Tools in your event: Toggle Mute-All, Message All, Amplify My Voice, Go On-Air (FrontRow events only), Toggle Stage Blocker and Host Panel.

### Contextual Roles - Available when you edit your event:

Host* - All the same abilities as Presenter above^, including Host Tools.
Megaphone Only - Gives that user access to Host Tools but only Amplify My Voice.
Moderator* - As above^.
Musical Performer - Better quality audio for singers or musicians playing instruments.
Pilot - Adds flight capabilities for that individual. NOTE: Must enable this in Settings/Input/Fly
Presenter* - As above^.
Terraformer - Adds the World Editor button to their interface.
* = Anyone with these roles is able to enter the event early by going to Events/My Events/YourEvent. This is great for tech checks and rehearsals!

### Mid-Event Role Promotion

Anyone with the Presenter/Host Role can assign roles to users that are in your event, during your event, using Host Tools/Host Panel/Guests/Select Guest:

**Make Host**: Gives that user the Host Role for the rest of the event.
**Make Moderator**: Gives that user the Moderator Role for the rest of the event.

### Adding More Admins To Your Event

You can add other users as Admins to help you manage your event. Perhaps you are already busy Hosting your event, they can help add roles, start/end times or descriptions of your event. Be careful as they can edit anything on your event web page, including Delete Event, so make sure you trust any Admins you’re adding.
To add an Admin - Edit your event, click Advanced Options then look under the Advanced section for Admins, click Add User and add their username. NOTE: This only gives them the Admin role, if you want them to have any other roles (Host, Presenter, Moderator) these need to be added like normal under Contextual Roles.

### Giving Everyone In Your Event A Role

Some events benefit when all users can have super powers! For example, if your event is in a large area you might want everyone to have the ability to Fly and Amplify My Voice so you can all hear each other from far away. To add this, edit your event, click Advanced Options and under the In VR section is Default Contextual Roles. Rollover the green circle for all the roles you can add. For the example above you’d add: megaphone_only, pilot
NOTE: Each person must enable this in Settings/Input/Fly.

## Roles in worlds

You’ll need to create your World first, then add the roles after. Once you’ve created your World on the website, click the EDIT button, that’ll open up the Contextual Roles ‘Add User’ button. This is where you add AltspaceVR usernames to give out roles for your World.

### World Creator Roles - When you create a World you automatically get these two Roles:

Admin - All World management tools via the website. You can Edit, View: Diagnostics – Objects – Template - Backups, Delete and Feature My World.
Moderator - Enables you to Mute, Message or Kick users from your World by either using the buttons on that avatar’s nametag or by using the Host Tools/Host Panel to do the same

### Contextual Roles - Available when you edit your World:

Megaphone Only - Gives that user access to Host Tools but only Amplify My Voice.
Moderator - As above^.
Musical Performer - Better quality audio for singers or musicians playing instruments.
Pilot - Adds flight capabilities for that individual. NOTE: Must enable this in Settings/Input/Fly
Presenter - As above^.
Terraformer - Adds the World Editor button to their interface.

### Adding More Admins To Your World

Edit your World, click Advanced Options then look under the Advanced section for Admins, click Add User and add their username. NOTE: This only gives them the Admin role, if you want them to have any other roles (Host, Presenter, Moderator) these need to be added like normal under Contextual Roles.

## Roles in groups

You won’t be adding Presenter or Moderator roles to a Group but you are able to add Admins to help you organize your Group. Be careful as they can edit your Group, including Delete, so make sure you trust any Admins you’re adding.

### Adding More Admins To Your Group

You’ll need to create your Group first, then add Admins after. Once you’ve created your Group on the website, click the EDIT button, scroll down and you’ll see the Admins Add User button where you can add usernames.
