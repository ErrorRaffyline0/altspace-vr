# Exploring AltspaceVR

![AltspaceVR banner image](images/altspace-vr-banner.png)

AltspaceVR is a leading social platform for virtual reality. Focused on events ranging in scale from arena-sized concerts to specialty meet ups, AltspaceVR uses technology to help you scale your human connection.

Whether you're a seasoned AltspaceVR veteran or a new user, it's important to have solid resources that you can count on. We've compiled the following checkpoints to walk you through bringing your virtual events to the world. You can cover them sequentially, which is what we recommend, or jump around at will if you know what you're looking for. Either way, you'll want to revisit this journey whenever you need direction.

## 1. Getting started

Before you start creating and hosting your own virtual events, you'll need the right tools and accounts. By the end of this section, you'll have your system properly configured and ready to go!

## 2. Getting comfortable

Since AltspaceVR events take place in the virtual world, you need to get comfortable navigating virtual space. By the end of this section, you'll be confidently moving around, controlling avatars, and using keyboard shortcuts.

## 3. For guests & audiences

You don't always have to be a host in AltspaceVR - sometimes you'll be a guest an audience member. For these occasions, you'll want to be familiar with the features and menus that come with the new territory.
