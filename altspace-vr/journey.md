# Exploring AltspaceVR

AltspaceVR is a leading social platform for virtual reality. Focused on events ranging in scale from arena-sized concerts to specialty meet ups, AltspaceVR uses technology to help you scale your human connection.

Whether you're a seasoned AltspaceVR veteran or a new user, it's important to have solid resources that you can count on. We've compiled the following checkpoints to walk you through bringing your virtual events to the world. You can cover them sequentially, which is what we recommend, or jump around at will if you know what you're looking for. Either way, you'll want to revisit this journey whenever you need direction.
