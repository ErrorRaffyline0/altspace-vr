### Best practices

- **AltspaceVR is built for scaling**
  - Each virtual room/environment can support up to 50 avatars simultaneously*.
  - You can multiply rooms for unlimited capacity using the [FrontRow feature](/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/faqs/scaling-audiences).
- **Limit customization**
  - Yes, you can import an entire original Unity scene in AltspaceVR, but this does not guarantee your event or world will be performant for your guests.
  - *Customization can impact the number of avatars in your environment and the quality of the audience experience. Simplicity is key & official AltspaceVR templates are the most reliable.
- **Practice makes perfect**
  - Like with any other technology, the more you use it, the more comfortable you feel.
  - Before you host an event, we highly recommend spending time in AltspaceVR.
  - Just like in real life, it’s best to plan rehearsals or run-throughs.
- **Helpful timelines**
  - Create your event at least two weeks prior to scheduled showtime so that you can get comfortable, test your setup, and promote your event. Having an optimized world ≠ a successful event without testing your actual pencils-down event space.
  - Finalize your Unity template at least 48 hours prior to showtime. Any additions after that point may risk your event’s success.
  - Test early and test often. Being cross-platform is important to AltspaceVR. We recommend ensuring that you are testing your spaces on all the various types of hardware you expect to be used by your hosts and audience members.
  - Give your guests ample time to download, sign up for, and get into AltspaceVR. Encourage guests to go through set-up at least 30 minutes before the event start time.
- **Planning and Communications**
  - Having an organized team to help is key. Figure out how many hosts, moderators, camera-bots, and general staff you’ll need for your event.
    - We recommend at least two people for a single-room event.
    - It’s always helpful to have someone checking things like email (or relevant support channels) during the event, so no guest is left behind.
  - Clear communication with your guests is important. Help attendees understand how to:
    - Download AltspaceVR: install AltspaceVR [here](https://altvr.com/get-altspacevr/), and check for the [mininum hardware specs](/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/getting-started/system-requirements).
    - [Create an Account](beginners-guide.md#creating-accounts) in AltspaceVR. If you're using the Groups feature, we recommend asking your guests to first create AltspaceVR accounts, and then send you their usernames to add to the Group.
    - Find your event: share your event's [entry code](beginners-guide.md#entry-codes), offer your guests instructions on [how to navigate the menu](beginners-guide.md#main-menu).
    - Reach out to your team if they need support: share your best support contact and contact method.
