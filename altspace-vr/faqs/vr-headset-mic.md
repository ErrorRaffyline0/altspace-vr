# Does my VR headsets have a built-in mic?

## Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, and HTC Vive Users

These VR headsets do feature built-in microphones.

## Windows

For headsets used with Windows, you should be able to find the microphone listed under your **Recording Devices** while you have the headset plugged in.
