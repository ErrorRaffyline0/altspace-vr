# Unlinking and Re-Linking Your Microsoft Account

We highly recommend that you link your AltspaceVR account with a personal Microsoft Account. If you need to un-link your accounts for whatever reason, here is how to do so:

## How to Unlink Your AltspaceVR and Microsoft Accounts

1. Navigate to altvr.com and click "Log In"
2. Click "Sign in with Microsoft" and sign in with the Microsoft Account linked to your AltspaceVR account
3. Once you’re signed in, click on "More" > "Profile"
4. Click "Unlink Account" to perform the unlinking action
5. Now you can sign in on a classic AltspaceVR account or re-link to another Microsoft account
6. Run AltspaceVR


## How to Re-link Your AltspaceVR to Another Microsoft Account

1. Navigate to altvr.com and click "Log In"
2. Click "Sign in with Microsoft" and sign in with the Microsoft Account linked to your AltspaceVR account
3. Once you’re signed in, click on "More" > "Profile"
5. Click "Link Account" and sign in using your preferred personal Microsoft account
6. Run AltspaceVR


## Troubleshooting Tips

* If you are trying to link a Microsoft Account but you get an error saying "Email has already been taken" it’s likely that you have a classic AltspaceVR account with the same email as your Microsoft Account. We recommend you sign into altvr.com to link your account:
    1. Navigate to altvr.com and click "Log In"
    2. Sign in with your AltspaceVR account (email + password). If you don’t know your password, click "Reset Password" at the top of the page and follow the password recovery process. 
    3. Once you’re signed in, click on "More > Profile"
    4. Click "Link Account" and your classic Altspace account and Microsoft Account should now be linked. (NOTE: work or school accounts are currently not supported unless your administrator has told you otherwise.)
    5. Run Altspace and sign in with your Microsoft Account
    
* If you are trying to use the consumer version of AltspaceVR, you need to use a Microsoft account. If you use a work or school account, you will get an error message prompting you to link to a personal Microsoft Account instead. Follow the steps above to unlink and re-link accounts. 

* Submit your logs if you run into any issues by going to **MAIN MENU > SETTINGS > SUPPORT > Upload Logs**.
