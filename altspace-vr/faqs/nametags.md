# How do nametags work?

If you'd like to see another user's Nametag, select their avatar with your cursor and their Nametag will, then display above.

You'll see a few icons on the Nametag: **Friend, Block,** and **Mute**.

* **Mute:** Clicking the Mute icon will allow you to mute a user, this is a temporary mute and you can unmute them at any time. If this users' mute icon is already red, it means they've muted themselves.

* **Block:** The block feature will allow you to remove a user from your experience. You'll no longer see or hear that user, and they'll no longer see or hear you. If you need to unblock a user, open up your Friends panel in AltspaceVR, select the block tab, then unblock the user.

* **Friending:** The friend button will send that user a friend request, after Friending another user you can message them across spaces, see when that user is online, and easily join their room. That user's Nametag will also include a blue border so you can easily recognize them as a friend. You'll also notice a counter at the bottom of their Nametag, which will show the duration that you've been friends with that user.

When you host your own activity, you'll receive some other tools for moderation. You'll now have the ability to message users who you aren't yet friends with, and you'll also have the ability to Kick users.

* **Kick:** If a user interrupts your activity you can always use the Kick button, this will remove that user from your activity. After being kicked they, they'll no longer be able to join your current activity. 

* **Admin Badge:** AltspaceVR has staff on hand 24/7 in The Campfire to assist you in VR. All staff members representing AltspaceVR will have the gold Admin Badge on their nametag.

Our staff is here to support and assist you, so please ask them any questions you might have!
