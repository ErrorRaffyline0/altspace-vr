# Is there a push-to-talk button?

In the lower right of your view, there is a microphone button that can be used to toggle whether your voice is being shared to other users. Alternatively, you may use the keyboard shortcut, **Ctrl + Alt + T** to toggle this setting. 
 
If the icon blinks when you talk, your microphone is working!
