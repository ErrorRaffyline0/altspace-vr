# Mesh in Microsoft Teams frequently asked questions

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Mesh?

Microsoft Mesh is a new platform built on Microsoft Azure.  Microsoft Mesh allows you to build collaborative mixed reality experiences across platforms and devices. Using Mesh, you can build immersive 3D and multi-user experiences, where people come together virtually to create and collaborate on 3D content.  You can use Mesh to enhance virtual meetings, conduct virtual design sessions, assist remotely better, learn together virtually, host virtual social gatherings and meet-ups.

### Who should use Mesh in Microsoft Teams (previously called AltspaceVR for Business)?

>[!Note]
>AltspaceVR for Business will now be called Mesh in Microsoft Teams.

Enterprise companies who are looking for a secure way to collaborate with presence. The platform offers an organizational view to your Admins.  They can setup and choose the worlds and events specific to your organization, which are made available to all your employees.

### Which platforms and devices does Mesh in Microsoft Teams support?

Mesh in Microsoft Teams is available on Windows Mixed Reality devices, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift/Rift-S, Oculus Quest/Quest 2, and on PC/Mac in 2D mode.

### What are the system requirements?  

See [minimum system requirements](/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/getting-started/system-requirements).

### What are the advantages to having meeting/events in VR? 

Virtual meetings lack an experience that is as captivating as in-person meetings. Today, meeting attendees passively observe virtual meetings or experience fatigue, as it lacks the same level of engagement and interaction as in-person meetings. Meeting organizers miss the immersive environment that occupies everyone’s attention, brings people together, and allows dynamic collaboration, in which organizers rely on for in-person meetings. Now with Mesh for Teams, meetings can bring colleagues together and be filled with more immersive and interactive experiences. 

Virtual reality allows you to engage with your team members with more presence, making collaboration and socialization easier using many features including spatial audio. There is no travel, which saves time, money, carbon footprints.

### How many people can attend a large scale event?  

Mesh for Teams should support the maximum number of participants allowed in a Teams meeting of 1,000 people.

### Can people outside of my organization attend events?  

Yes! You can allow guests to access your event by selecting **Allow External Attendees** while setting up your event. They'll gain access to the event by going into the Altspace app and using the event's custom Entry Code. 

### How much does it cost to use Altspace? 

A Mesh subscription will be required to use Altspace. The subscription will be free during the Public Preview and then roll into a paid subscription by the time the product hits General Availability.

Yes. Altspace for Business supports the ability to add your company logo and customized loading screen tips.

### Can we create our own 3D environments or objects with Unity?

### Can I share my desktop or browser in Altspace?

### Can I make a custom avatar?

### Will my organization mix with non-organizational users? Will my company be able to see other Altspace public events/worlds? 

To protect your users and IP, your employees will have a gated experience which will not allow them to interact with regular users or events. However, they can sign up for a personal account using their personal email within the same app to access public user content.

### What will my employees see when they enter AltspaceVR?  

Your employees will be able to see the events and worlds you pre-select for them. 

### Can I use Microsoft 365 Groups to create different groups that will work with Altspace? So, for example, only Marketing can access a Marketing specific meeting?

Only people in that group will be able to see and access this Group event in AltspaceVR.

### How many different AltspaceVR environments are there to choose from for event/world locations? 

There are 25+ AltspaceVR event/world templates to choose from, not including custom ones designed and built by your organization. 

### Can you recommend to us a 3rd party to create custom environments?

Absolutely! Please contact our support team to receive recommendations: <altvr.com/support>. 

### Will you support other VR headsets like the Vive Focus, Pico or Valve Index in the future?

Though we don't have a public date around availability, we aim to deploy AltspaceVR on as many different platforms as possible. Altspace will run on many devices, but some issues may exist. 

### What if I already have a personal Altspace Microsoft Account? Can I continue to use both a work and personal account?

Yes. You can log in with your personal MSA to access our consumer version of Altspace, and then log in with your AAD account  to access  Altspace for Business which is specific to your organization. Note - the consumer and enterprise versions of Altspace are mutually exclusive so you will not be able to access consumer content when you are logged in with your AAD account. 

## Appendix

### Can I whiteboard? Take notes? Use stickynotes? (Do we want a 'no we don't have this' section?) 

Coming soon! Our goal is to support whiteboarding and collaboration tools through the Teams client by the time we release in March. <mark> But it's not clear yet whether we will be able to hit that goal. </mark>

### Can you provide us with specific DNS names or an IP range to allow through our firewall to use Altspace? The ones you provide are too generic and our security team will not open ports without a destination address or range. 

Open UDP ports 5055 and 5056, and TCP ports 80 and 443". <mark> At the bottom: "More advanced support for network administrators or IT departments, including Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags, can be found in our download details."</mark>

<mark> Michelle: I don't know if this question will still be relevant if we ship via Teams, so let's put this in the appendix and revisit once we have a clearer picture of the product direction.

### What will my employees see when they enter AltspaceVR?  

Your employees will be able to see the events and worlds you pre-select for them. 

<mark> Michelle: This is TBD based on the product direction so let's put this in the Appendix for now

### How many different AltspaceVR environments are there to choose from for event/world locations?
