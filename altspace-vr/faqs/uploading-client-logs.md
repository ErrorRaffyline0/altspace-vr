# How do I upload my client logs?

The AltspaceVR client application keeps a log of diagnostic data and events that occur while you're using AltspaceVR. In the course of troubleshooting an issue, you may be asked to "upload your logs" so that our team can review them. This is a feature of AltspaceVR that allows you to send our team your local log content to help us troubleshoot your issue.

## In AltspaceVR

To upload client logs in AltspaceVR, navigate to the **settings menu** and select **Support** in the left navigation bar. Several options to upload logs are available here, as shown in the screenshot below.

## Fields

**"What Went Wrong?"**
Describe what happened - for example, if you find a bug, describe what you expected to happen in contrast to what actually happened). This information will be sent along with the log when you press upload.

**"Upload Logs"**
This button will upload logs from the current session. Use this option if you find an issue in this same session (for example, if you haven't closed the AltspaceVR client) and would like to report it.

**"Upload Last Logs"**
This button will upload logs from the previous session.

**"Upload Last Crash Log"**
This button will upload more log content from the latest crash you've experienced.

## In Client Logs

You can also retrieve your log files from your computer. Instructions on how to retrieve these logs can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/faqs/app-version#in-client-logs).

Once you've located those files, [open a support ticket](https://help.altvr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and upload your logs on your ticket request before clicking submit.
