# My audio is choppy

Some users have noticed that when another avatar is speaking the audio comes across as choppy, or with regular drop-outs. You may in other instances be informed by other users that your own audio is coming through choppy, or robotic.

The first thing to try is always reentering the space you are in, or even restarting AltspaceVR if this fails. Audio issues aren't common but when they do occur this is often an easy fix. 

If this fails these are some other things, you can investigate. 

## For Desktop Users

### CPU Performance

Review our [Recommended System Specifications](../getting-started/system-requirements.md) for hardware we suggest for running AltspaceVR. We've found that CPUs i3's and lower cause issues not only with the frame rates of the video, but can contribute to audio issues such as drop-outs and poor quality.

### Internet Bandwidth and Network Connection

Users on slow internet connections (less than 5mbps) or on WiFi may have audio issues such as drop-outs. We recommend hardline connection of an Ethernet cable to your computer, and a connection faster than 5mbps. You may want to exit any programs that might be using internet connectivity in the background.
