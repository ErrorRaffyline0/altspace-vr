      - question: Why should I make my software or services available in the Microsoft commercial marketplace?
        answer: |
          The commercial marketplace is a starting point for go-to-market collaboration and enablement with sales channels and Marketplace Rewards. The websites and in-product experiences give your products visibility to millions of customers who are seeking solutions like yours. You don't even need to build or buy the commerce capabilities. 
          The commercial marketplace is available in 141 regions, on a per-plan basis. 
          We manage tax payment in many countries/regions, and we provide access to our global channel network of resellers. You can use a customer's Microsoft Customer Agreement or Enterprise Agreement to sell to organizations without having to create a new buying relationship.
          To learn more, see the [Microsoft commercial marketplace hub](https://aka.ms/commercialmarketplacehub).
