# Getting started with the World Editor

The World Editor contains the tools and abilities you need to spawn, manipulate, and place objects and elements in order to construct a world. It is role-dependent, which means that you’ll only be able to access the World Editor in places that are yours to customize freely (your home-space, your events, your worlds). In these spaces, your World Editor appears on the lower right-hand corner of your field of view.

The primary button in your World Editor is your **Editor Panel**. This will open your one-stop-shop window from which you have access to most of the world editing controls. The Editor Panel helps you easily tell at-a-glance which items are selected and whether they’re locked or unlocked. Items are correspondingly highlighted both in-world and in your Editor Panel, to make finding them simple.

When you scroll over an object, a blue highlight boundary will appear. Click the object to select it. The boundary will stay blue as long as it's selected. You can also lock an object in place to make sure it's positioned exactly where you'd like it to be. By locking the object, you will see the highlight boundary color turn red. These colors and visual cues correspond in your Editor Panel, as well, making it easy to see what you're working on and what state an object is in.

The additional buttons above the Editor Panel are quick short-cuts to helpful features and functions that make world-building a little smoother. 

Use your **Edit Mode** button to quickly toggle between the edit and live states. The button lights up when toggled on, so you’re able to tell which state you’re in at-a-glance even if you close your World Editor. If you're working with interactables in your World, (items that have interactable properties, like a basketball) these will be static as long as they're selected. To enable interactivity, you must de-select the item and exit Edit Mode.

Use your **Toggle Environment** button to hide or display your space. This is helpful for easy-access to items that you have placed throughout the world. By turning the environment off you'll be able to see with less visual "noise" in your field of view.

Use your **Toggle Flight** button to enable the ability to defy gravity. Who needs a scaffolding when you can soar through the skies? Use this feature to take your “construction site” to the next level. Flying is simple: just look in the direction you want to fly and use your hot-keys (or thumbstick on controller) to get there. 

Use your **Environment Clipping** button to pass through objects with ease so you can maneuver around in 3D space without getting tripped up by the items in your world. Being able to clip through items and walls give you total freedom of movement, so you can get your World perfect, down to the smallest details.  

Remember, practice makes perfect. So hop in-world and get building with the World Editor!
