# Adding welcome messages

When you enter a World you may see a welcome message like this:

![New signin message for a world]()

World-Builders can add an optional message that is shown to every person when they enter your World. This can be helpful if your World has flying enabled and you want visitors to turn flying on. 

1. On our website, navigate to [Worlds > Mine](https://account.altvr.com/users/sign_in), and edit your World
2. Enter your message in the "Instructions" field and click "Update"

![Editing world instructional message]()

3. In Altspace, enter your World and then you should see the updated message

## Troubleshooting

* The lines are not wrapping / super long
    * Try hitting enter in the text field so it goes to the next line.
* How do I make my text colorful?
    * Check out the [advanced syntax](http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/#color)
    * Only a few tags are supported and color is one of them
* People keep seeing the message every time they enter
    * Currently, it's not possible to dismiss this message permanently but we may add this feature in the future
