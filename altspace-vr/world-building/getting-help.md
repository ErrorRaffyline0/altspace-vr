# Where can I get help?

Friends don't let friends build worlds alone. Here are some ways to get help:

* Search through this [Knowledge Base](../index.yml) and browse through the [world-building section](world-editor-getting-started.md), in particular. Create an account (Click "Sign In" at the top right, then "Sign Up") and Follow this section to get alerted when new articles are published.
* Join the [World Builders Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/altspacevr). Most world-builders and some Altspace engineers hang out here. Try asking questions in the #help channel.
* Join the [MRE SDK Discord](https://discord.gg/xyBcQec). For more advanced world-builders who use our programming Software Development Kit (SDK) and Unity tools.
