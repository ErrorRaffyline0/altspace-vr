# Where can I get help?

Friends don't let friends build worlds alone. Here are some ways to get help:

Search through this Knowledge Base and browse through the world-building section, in particular. Create an account (Click "Sign In" at the top right, then "Sign Up") and Follow this section to get alerted when new articles are published.
Join the World Builders Discord. Most world-builders and some Altspace engineers hang out here. Try asking questions in the #help channel.
Join the MRE SDK Discord. For more advanced world-builders who use our programming Software Development Kit (SDK) and Unity tools.
