# Accessing the latest features

The Early Access program gives you access to the latest features that are still in development and it's free. Weâ€™re working on things that may not be finished but we'd still like you to see. Why? We want to know what you think. Do you like them? Are they valuable to you? Are they annoying? Your feedback is valuable to us and will ultimately help make a better AltspaceVR. Many world building features are only available to users who are in Early Access--here's how you can opt in:

## Join the Early Access program from within your app

1. Open your **Main Menu** to **Settings > General** and turn on **Participate in Early Access Program**:

## Troubleshooting

* I don't have a particular ability
    * Did you restart AltspaceVR? Abilities are loaded when you first start AltspaceVR.
    * Are you using the latest version of AltspaceVR? Open your Menu to **Settings** > **About** to check. 
    * Some abilities are only available to admins and some are only available in certain places. For example, you may have special abilities in your Homespace but not in a public World. Confirm with an admin whether you should have a particular ability in that context.
