# Creating your first AltspaceVR world

Welcome, World-Builder!

This guide will help you create and share your first AltspaceVR World! The instructions below step you through creating a world in your browser. You can also create worlds using the AltspaceVR app in your headset.

## Create a world on the AltspaceVR website

1. Sign up for your free AltspaceVR account if you haven't done so already.
1. If you're new to AltspaceVR, we recommend that you complete both of the tutorials. To reach them, open the AltspaceVR app, and on the main screen, click **Tutorials**.

1. In your browser, go to [https://altvr.com/](https://altvr.com/) and sign in.
1. In the top-level menu bar, click **More**, and then select **Worlds**.

1. In the **Worlds** menu bar, select **My Worlds**.
1. Click the **Create Universe** button.
1. On the **Create Universe** screen, enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your universe.
1. Under **Image**, select **Choose File**, and then select an image. This image will be used to promote your universe on the Web and in VR.
1. Under **Profile Image**, select **Choose File**, and then select an image. This image will also be used to promote your universe on the Web and in VR but it appears on the Universe page.
1. If desired, fill in the remaining text boxes:

    **Youtube Video ID**

    **Twitter Handle**

    **Tags**

1. Click the **Create Universe** button.

    After your universe is created, it appears on a new page and these options become available on the lower left (you have to scroll down a little to see them):

1. Click the **Create World** button.
1. Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your universe.
2. Under **Privacy Settings**, select **Private** or **Unlisted**.

> [!NOTE]
> Private worlds can only be joined by the owner or a universe administrator. Unlisted worlds are available for others to join, but do not appear in the UI--they need an explicit invite. Public worlds are discoverable in the Worlds menu and the Friends list.

2. If needed, fill in the remaining text boxes and the Advanced options:

    **Default Contextual Roles**

    **Advance Formatting**

    You need to select a template so you'll have a virtual environment to start with. You can change this later.

3. On the right side of the screen, select a template.

    You can choose a template provided by AltspaceVR or one that you've built. To see your templates (which contain the label **OWNER**), scroll down to the bottom of the screen.

## Share your World

    - Go to the main page of the AltspaceVR app and on the Button bar, click **Discover**.
   
    > ![Screenshot showing how to reach the Campfire.](images/010-campfire.png)

   - In the **Featured Hub Spaces** section, select **Commons Campfire**.
   - Click the **Enter** button which is located under the description in the top left corner.



2. After you enter the Campfire, click the Menu button in the lower left corner ...
