# Creating your first AltspaceVR world

Welcome, World-Builder!

This guide will help you create and share your first AltspaceVR World! The instructions below step you through creating a world in your browser. You can also create worlds using the AltspaceVR app in your headset.

## Create a world on the AltspaceVR website

1. Sign up for your free AltspaceVR account if you haven't done so already.
1. If you're new to AltspaceVR, we recommend that you complete both of the tutorials. To reach them, open the AltspaceVR app, and on the main screen, click **Tutorials**.
