4. Use the World Editor to make a label:

Congratulations! You've created your first Altspace World, your own multiplayer social VR experience! Play around with the World Editor, starting with Kits that contain objects you can place and manipulate.

## Sharing

1. Go to the Campfire (or wherever the people you want to share with are)
2. Open your Menu, find your World again, and select "Info":
