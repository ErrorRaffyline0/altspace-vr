# Creating your first AltspaceVR world

Welcome, World-Builder!

This guide will help you create and share your first AltspaceVR World! The instructions below step you through creating a world in your browser. You can also create worlds using the AltspaceVR app in your headset.

## Create a world on the AltspaceVR website

1. Sign up for your free AltspaceVR account if you haven't done so already.
1. If you're new to AltspaceVR, we recommend that you complete both of the tutorials. To reach them, open the AltspaceVR app, and on the main screen, click **Tutorials**.

1. In the AltspaceVR app, go to the main page and then click **Main Menu**.

1. Click the **Settings** button.
1. Turn the **Enable Worlds Beta** setting on.

    This makes the **WORLDS** button appear in the button bar and also enables the **My Worlds** option on the AltspaceVR website.

1. In your browser, go to [https://altvr.com/](https://altvr.com/) and sign in.
1. In the top-level menu bar, click **More**, and then select **Worlds**.

1. In the **Worlds** menu bar, select **My Worlds**.
1. Click the **Create Universe** button.
1. On the **Create Universe** screen, enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your universe.
1. To enable only the owner of the universe to join it, select **Private**.
1. Under **Image**, click **Choose File**, and then select an image. This image will be used to promote your universe on the Web and in VR.
1. Under **Profile Image**, click **Choose File**, and then select an image. This image will also be used to promote your universe on the Web and in VR but it appears on the Universe page.
1. If desired, fill in the remaining text boxes:

    **Youtube Video ID**

    **Twitter Handle**

    **Tags**

1. Click the **Create Universe** button.

    After your universe is created, it appears on a new page and these options become available on the lower left (you have to scroll down a little to see them):

1. Click the **Create World** button.
1. Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your world.
1. Under **Privacy Settings**, select **Private** or **Unlisted**.

> [!NOTE]
> As noted above, private worlds can only be joined by the owner or a universe administrator. Unlisted worlds are available for others to join, but do not appear in the UI--they need an explicit invite. If you select neither option, your world is public. Public worlds are discoverable in the Worlds menu and the Friends list.

1. If desired, fill in the remaining text boxes and the Advanced options:

    **Default Contextual Roles**

    **Advance Formatting**



1. On the right side of the screen, select a template. This gives you a virtual environment to start with--you can change it later.

    You can choose a template provided by AltspaceVR or one that you've built. To see your templates (which contain the label **OWNER**), scroll down to the bottom of the screen.

## View your world in the AltspaceVR app

1. In the AltspaceVR app, click the **WORLDS** button, and then, in the top menu bar, click **MY WORLDS**. This displays the **FEATURED WORLDS** window, which displays the world you created on the AltspaceVR website.
1. Move the cursor over the world you created, and note that two buttons appear: **ENTER** and **INFO**. Click the **INFO** button and view the details about your world. When you have finished, click the **ENTER** button in the lower left of the Info screen.

Congratulations! You've created and entered your first Altspace World, your own multiplayer social VR experience! We recommend that you play around with the World Editor, starting with Kits that contain objects you can place and manipulate.

## Share your World

1. Go to the Campfire (or wherever the people you want to share with are).

    **Tip**: The Campfire is a gathering spot where you can meet up with other community members or find a Community Helper or Community Support Team Member who can answer your Altspace questions and show you around. 
    
    To go to the Campfire:
    - Go to the main page of the AltspaceVR app and on the Button bar, click **Discover**.
   
    > ![Screenshot showing how to reach the Campfire.](images/010-campfire.png)

   - In the **Featured Hub Spaces** section, select **Commons Campfire**.
   - Click the **Enter** button which is located under the description in the top left corner.

2. After you enter the Campfire, click the Menu button in the lower left corner ...

    ![Screenshot showing the Menu button.](images/011-menu-button.png)

4. Find your World, and then hover the cursor over it and select **Info**:
