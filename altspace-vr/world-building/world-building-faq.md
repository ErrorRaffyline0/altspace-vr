# World-building help

1. **What is a World? What is a Universe?**
An Altspace "World" is a virtual place that people can join and hang out in. A "Universe" is a collection of Worlds. For example, the "Star Wars" Universe might contain the Worlds "Tatooine" and "Coruscant".

2. **How do I get started?**
We anticipated your needs and created this guide.

3. **How do I manage my Worlds and Universes?**
You can do this on our website. Here's a guide. 

4. **Can I backup my Worlds?**
Yes, there are a few ways, mainly you save restore Backups (currently called Snapshots in the client)

5. **Is there an Undo/Redo feature?**
We're working on it.
