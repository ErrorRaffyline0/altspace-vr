# Managing worlds

You’re in luck! See our [World-Building Getting Started Guide](world-building-getting-started.md) to visit your first personal World. If you want to use advanced features or create other Worlds and Universes, this guide is for you. Limited World controls are available in VR and full controls are available on our website.

## Creating extra Worlds

1. Navigate to [Worlds > Mine](https://account.altvr.com/worlds/my)

2. You should see your Home and your default Universe. A Universe is a collection of Worlds. It makes it easier to organize all the amazing Worlds you’re going to build. Choose your default Universe and then select “Create World”:

3. Your default Universe will have a default World.
4. Choose a Template. You'll start with a few basic ones. Check out the [Unity Uploader](world-building-toolkit-getting-started.md) if you’re interested in creating your own Templates. Fill in the details and make sure you upload an image. That will give people an idea of how your World looks. Select “Create” when you’re ready.

5. Congrats on your brand new World! You can choose “Enter Now” to launch Altspace or share the link to this page with your friends. In VR, you can find it under Worlds > My Worlds. There’s no limit to the number of Worlds you can create.

## Creating Extra Universes
