AltspaceVR does not endorse any content on such External Sites. The content of such External Sites is not developed or provided by AltspaceVR, and AltspaceVR is not responsible for such Content.

Take precautions when downloading files from all websites to protect your devices from viruses and other destructive programs. If you decide to access any External Sites, then you do so at your own risk.

6. Feedback.  

    While our own staff works to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features, we pride ourselves on paying close attention to the interests, feedback, comments, and suggestions we receive from the User community. If you choose to contribute by sending AltspaceVR or our employees any ideas for or suggestions, including copyrighted content, for the Service or another product (collectively **“Feedback”**), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say, the Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and AltspaceVR is not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you send confidential, or to use such Feedback.

    AltspaceVR respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Users to do the same.

INQUIRIES NOT RELEVANT TO THIS PROCEDURE WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

8. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

    If You Live In the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. "We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates.

    1. Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.

    1. Mail a Notice of Dispute First. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499>. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.

    1. Small Claims Court Option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court if you meet the court’s requirements in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A.

    1. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see <https://www.adr.org> or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497> to the AAA and mail a copy to us. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim. But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.

    1. Arbitration Fees and Payments.

        1. <u>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less</u>. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.

        1. <u>Disputes Involving More than $75,000</u>. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

    1. Conflict with AAA Rules. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. 

    1. Must File Within One Year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.

    1. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.

    1. Severability. If any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, section 15 will be unenforceable in its entirety.

9. Warranties and Liability.  

    1. Your Warranty to AltspaceVR.  
    You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content Posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms; (ii) the posting and use of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person visible in any of your User Content; and (iii) our exercise of rights granted in these Terms will not require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties.

If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in this EULA or have such music publisher enter into this EULA with us. You are granting AltspaceVR the right to Use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (for example, a record label), a musical work copyright owner (for example, a music publisher), a performing rights organization (for example, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording PRO (for example, SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers, or other royalty participants involved in the creation of any User Content. All of the rights you grant in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of External Sites will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or Used on such External Sites via the Service. 

    2. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY.

AltspaceVR’S AND MICROSOFT’S LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO U.S. $100. 

    3. RELEASE FROM LIABILITY.  
    ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CARRIER OR OTHER USER), IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE AltspaceVR AND MICROSOFT FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. 

10. Indemnification.  

    To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless AltspaceVR and Microsoft from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your access to, use, or misuse of the AltspaceVR Content or the Service; or (c) your User Content. AltspaceVR will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. AltspaceVR reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section if AltspaceVR believes that you are unwilling or incapable of defending AltspaceVR’s interests. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting AltspaceVR’s defense of such matter at your expense.

11. Consent to Electronic Communications.  

    By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

12. Miscellaneous.  

    These Terms are governed by the laws of Washington State without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that by submitting User Content, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created between you and AltspaceVR other than as specifically set forth in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect. Failure of AltspaceVR to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms. No waiver will be effective against AltspaceVR unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by AltspaceVR and you, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and AltspaceVR with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein. The Section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import. These Terms will inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns. You may not assign these Terms or any of the rights or licenses granted hereunder, directly or indirectly, without the prior express written consent of AltspaceVR. AltspaceVR may assign these Terms, including all its rights hereunder, without restriction.
