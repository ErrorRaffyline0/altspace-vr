# Community helper guide

The Vote to Suspend feature is available exclusively to AltspaceVR's Community Helpers. It's a moderation tool to help keep AltspaceVR welcoming, safe, and mature. Vote-to-Suspend allows Community Helpers to flag anyone who violates of our Community Guidelines. Below are the official rules and responsibilities associated with the Vote-to-Suspend ability. 

## Vote-to-Suspend Rules & Responsibilities: 

**Rules** 

* Suspension is only permitted if a user violates of AltspaceVR's Community Guidelines. No other reasons. No exceptions.  
* Underaged users must explicitly identify themselves as under 13 years of age before you can vote to suspend them. 
* All votes are logged and tracked in our system. 
* You must be willing and able to explain your reasoning for voting to a banned user if asked to elaborate. 

**Responsibilities** 

* Get help from the CST in the Campfire if you meet someone who is particularly difficult and you're unsure about how best to continue.  
* If you meet someone who might require immediate suspension, seek help from the CST in the Campfire. 
* New people may not always know what's right and wrong, so please be patient and kind. Remember always to set the example for being a good AltspaceVR citizen means. 
* Help answer questions to the best of your abilities. If you're unsure about an answer, that's ok. 
* Open a ticket with our support team if you have a technical issue or need troubleshooting assistance: [altvr.com/support/](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=114093998653)

**Remember** 

* You can toggle your Community Helper badge on/off. When you toggle your badge "off," you'll also toggle "off" your Vote-to-Suspend ability. 
* The Vote-to-Suspend feature is a pilot program, and there are no guarantees to ensure future abilities.
