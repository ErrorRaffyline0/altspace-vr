# Community helper guide

The Vote to Suspend feature is available, exclusively to AltspaceVRâ€™s Community Helpers. It's a moderation tool to help keep AltspaceVR welcoming, safe, and mature. Vote-to-Suspend allows Community Helpers to flag anyone who is in violation of our Community Guidelines. Below are the official rules and responsibilities associated with the Vote-to-Suspend ability. 

## Vote-to-Suspend Rules & Responsibilities: 

**Rules** 

* Suspension is only permitted if a user is in violation of AltspaceVR's Community Guidelines. No other reasons. No exceptions.  
* Underaged users must explicitly identify themselves as being under 13 years of age before you can vote to suspend them. 
* All votes are logged and tracked in our system. 
* You must be willing and able to explain your reasoning for voting to a ban user, if asked to elaborate. 

**Responsibilities** 

* Get help from the CST in the Campfire if you meet someone who is particularly difficult and you're unsure about how best to continue.  
* If you meet someone who might require immediate suspension, seek help from the CST in the Campfire. 
* New people may not always know what's right and wrong, so please be patient and kind. Remember to always set the example for what being a good AltspaceVR citizen means. 
* Help answer questions to the best of your abilities. If you're unsure about an answer that's ok. 
* Anyone with a technical issue or in need of troubleshooting should be encouraged to open a ticket with our support team: [altvr.com/support/](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=114093998653)

**Remember** 

* You can toggle your Community Helper badge on/off. When you toggle your badge "off", you'll also toggle "off" your Vote-to-Suspend ability. 
* The Vote-to-Suspend feature is a pilot program and no guarantees are made to ensure future abilities.
