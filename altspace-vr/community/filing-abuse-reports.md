# Filing an abuse report

We understand that there may be times when you feel compelled to let us know about an individual in AltspaceVR that is behaving poorly and disrupting the experience for others.

Before you submit a report, you do have tools for dealing with any disruptive user who is preventing you from having a positive experience. When you bring up a user's Name Tag by interacting with their avatar, you'll see several buttons. One of these tools will allow you to mute the user, and another will allow you to block them. You'll no longer hear the audio for any user you mute. Blocked users will no longer be seen or heard, and can no longer see or hear you. Additionally, if you're experiencing issues with other users invading your personal space, you can activate your Personal Space Bubble. Your Personal Space Bubble causes others to become invisible if they get too close to you. 

Take a moment to review our [Community Standards](community-standards.md), to determine if the individual's actions are violating our expectation of user behavior. If you feel it does warrant our attention, please [file an Abuse Report](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000032154). Make sure to provide a detailed account of your experience with the user, and an accurate spelling of their Display Name, and when the instance of abuse took place. 

We'll follow up where appropriate, and take the necessary action to maintain Altspace as a place where people feel safe and are free to communicate with others. We won't inform you about our decisions or the status of the individual's account.
