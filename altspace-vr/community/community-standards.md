# Community standards

The AltspaceVR Community Standards are a set of principles that will allow for community members to experience a truly fantastic environment without the threat of defamation and intolerance, bullying, and harassment, lewd behavior, or the display of offensive content. The following addresses each area and Microsoft's expectation of user behavior while logged into the AltspaceVR service or while posting on social media pages and forums managed by Microsoft.

## Defamation and Intolerance

AltspaceVR is an international community of users from many different cultural backgrounds. Each community member has their unique background, cultural practices, accents and mannerisms, belief structure, and reasons for being in VR. As a community enriched by this multi-cultural environment, there will be no tolerance for bigotry about any user's race, nationality, spiritual beliefs, physical abilities, or sexual orientation. Any language meant to defame or injure another user will result in an immediate account suspension and a determination of whether the account will be closed permanently.

## Harassment 

A healthy community is rooted in the shared understanding that everyone is entitled to feel and express whether something is offensive or uncomfortable for them. When a user chooses to ignore this and continue to aim the awkward behavior at that person, it's harassment. If another community member expresses that something makes them uncomfortable, you must cease that behavior in their presence. Continued harassing behavior will result in an account suspension and subsequent determination of whether the account will be closed permanently.

## Cyber-Bullying and Intimidation

While Cyber-Bullying is an issue affecting teens and pre-teens, we include it as part of the Community Standards. We clarify that any form of intimidation levied against another user, whether on the AltspaceVR platform or any social media or forum site managed by Microsoft, shall be grounds for suspension or account termination.

## Lewd or Unwanted Advances

We understand that there will be situations where two consenting adults may develop a relationship of a romantic or sexual nature. The sexual or romantic language used when one of the individuals has clearly expressed they aren't interested will be considered a lewd or unwanted advance. Continued advances are grounds for account suspension or termination, depending on the severity of the situation.

## Discovery and Disclosure of Personal Information

Community Members are entitled to a reasonable level of privacy on the AltspaceVR platform. Sharing personal information about your fellow users without their consent--including gender, religion, age, marital status, race, sexual preference, alternate account names, and real-world location beyond what is provided by them, isn't allowed. Discovering this information and using it to contact the person without the community member's consent will be considered inappropriate behavior and may be grounds for account suspension or termination.

## Impersonation of an AltspaceVR Employee

The AltspaceVR logo in the name tag that expands when you mouse-over or click the avatar can identify AltspaceVR staff. Employees will never ask for passwords to your account. Any account found to be impersonating an AltspaceVR employee will be subject to immediate suspension or termination.

## Inappropriate Content

Publicly accessible Events and or Worlds may NOT contain, as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion, any content that is obscene or explicit, violent, defamatory, disparaging, or illegal, or that promotes or that communicates messages that may reflect negatively on the goodwill of Microsoft (AltspaceVR). Public Events and or Worlds containing such content will be flagged as mature, set to private, or maybe removed entirely. Beaming content of an explicit nature, such as pornography, gruesome violence, and offensive lyrics, aren't tolerated in Public Events or Worlds. Mature content must be flagged as mature and set as private. No adult content may be publicly accessible. No exceptions. Any Event or World that grants free and open access to users beyond the event-creator or world-builder is considered "public." It may not contain inappropriate content or teleporters to inappropriate content/events/worlds. Attempts to display this content publicly will result in the suspension of the account and potentially permanent termination. Additionally, we expect users to choose a Username and First Name free of inappropriate terms. AltspaceVR may adjust these names at its discretion.

## Personal Space

AltspaceVR is a truly unique environment. The power of the platform is the ability to communicate verbally with fellow users and engage with them non-verbally through body gestures and the spatial positioning of your avatar. Like with real-world interaction, users in VR can feel social discomfort if those with who they're interacting are violating real-world personal space. This interaction may include the proximity of one avatar to another, the placement of motion-captured hands, arms, or legs close to the avatar's face, or even a high-speed approach and passing of one avatar through another. 2D users have to be aware that VR users experience these sensations differently. If a user expresses discomfort with a particular behavior and the activity continues, this can be considered harassment and may result in account suspension or termination.

## Warning, Suspension, Banishment

The staff of Microsoft understands that there's a learning curve with VR and 2D virtual environments. Some new users may inadvertently violate some of the less strict standards listed above. We ask that the community help us kindly teach others the nuances of existing in a virtual environment. We were all new to VR at one time. It's incredible how far calm and kind communication can go with people perceived as acting up. In cases where rational communication won't work, violations of the Community Standards will first result in a warning, followed by suspension and eventual termination of the AltspaceVR account. In-VR company representatives, called Concierges, may occasionally address disciplinary problems with a temporary removal from AltspaceVR. These individuals will have the AltspaceVR logo in their name tag.

## Alternate Accounts

While community members may choose to create and use more than one account, specifically or consistently using an alternate account to harass other users or violate the Community Standards isn't acceptable. Alternate accounts are separate from a user's principal account, but misuse of alternate accounts can result in disciplinary action on the principal account.

## Reporting Violations of the Community Standards

If you feel an individual has breached the Community Standards, you may file an Abuse Report with the AltspaceVR Community Team. Include an explanation of the incident, the account names of those involved, and the time and time it transpired. The AltspaceVR Community Team will review the report and take the appropriate action. As a policy, we don't provide details of those actions to the reporter. Don't follow up requesting the status of the decision.
