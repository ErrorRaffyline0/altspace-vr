# Community standards

The AltspaceVR Community Standards are a set of principles that will allow for community members to experience a truly amazing environment without the threat of defamation and intolerance, bullying, and harassment, lewd behavior, or the display of offensive content. The following address each of these areas and more, and what Microsoft's expectation of user behavior is while logged-in to the AltspaceVR service or while posting on social media pages and forums managed by Microsoft.

## Defamation and Intolerance

AltspaceVR is an international community of users that come from many different cultural backgrounds. Each community member has their own individual background, cultural practices, accents and mannerisms, belief structure and reasons for being in VR. As a community that is enriched by this multi-cultural environment, there will be no tolerance for bigotry about any user's race, nationality, spiritual beliefs, physical abilities, or sexual orientation. Any language that is meant to defame or injure another user will result in an immediate suspension and determination as to whether the account will be closed permanently.

## Harassment 

A healthy community is rooted in the shared understanding that everyone is entitled to feel and express whether something is offensive or uncomfortable for them. When a user chooses to ignore this and continue to aim the uncomfortable behavior at that person, it's perceived as Harassment. If another community member expresses that something makes them uncomfortable, it is your responsibility to cease that behavior in the presence of them. Continued harassing behavior will result in a suspension and subsequent determination as to whether the account will be closed permanently.

## Cyber-Bullying and Intimidation

While Cyber-Bullying is regarded as being an issue affecting teens and pre-teens, we're including it as part of the Community Standards so that we make it clear that any form of intimidation levied against another user be it on the AltspaceVR platform or on any social media or forum site managed by Microsoft, shall be considered grounds for suspension or account termination.

## Lewd or Unwanted Advances

We understand that there will be situations where two consenting adults may develop a relationship of a romantic or sexual nature. Sexual or romantic language that is used when one of the individuals has clearly expressed they aren't interested, will be considered to be a lewd or unwanted advance. This is considered to be grounds for account suspension or termination, dependent on the severity of the situation.

## Discovery and Disclosure of Personal Information

Community Members are entitled to a reasonable level of privacy on the AltspaceVR platform. Sharing personal information about your fellow users without their consent--including gender, religion, age, marital status, race, sexual preference, alternate account names, and real-world location beyond what is provided by them, isn't allowed. Discovering this information and using it to contact the person without the consent of the community member will be considered to be inappropriate behavior, and may be grounds for account suspension or termination.

## Impersonation of an AltspaceVR Employee

AltspaceVR staff can be identified by the AltspaceVR logo in the name tag that expands when you mouse-over, or click, the avatar. Employees will never ask for passwords to your account. Any account found to be impersonating an AltspaceVR employee will be subject to immediate suspension or termination.

## Inappropriate Content

Publicly accessible Events and/or Worlds may NOT contain, as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion, any content that is obscene or explicit, violent, defamatory, disparaging, or illegal, or that promotes or that communicates messages that may reflect negatively on the goodwill of Microsoft (AltspaceVR). Public Events and/or Worlds containing such content will be flagged as mature, set to private, or may be removed entirely. Beaming content of an explicit nature, such as pornography, gruesome violence, and offensive lyrics aren't tolerated in Public Events or Worlds. Mature content of any kind must be flagged as mature and must be set to private. No mature content may be publicly accessible. No exceptions. Any Event or World that grants free and open access to users beyond the event-creator or world-builder, is considered "public" and may not contain inappropriate content or teleporters to inappropriate content/events/worlds. Attempts to display this content publicly will result in the suspension of the account, and potentially permanent termination.  Additionally, we expect that users will choose a Username and First Name that is free of inappropriate terms. AltspaceVR may adjust these names at its discretion.

## Personal Space

AltspaceVR is a truly unique environment. The power of the platform is the ability to communicate verbally with fellow users, but also to engage with them non-verbally through body gestures and the spatial positioning of your avatar. Like with real-world interaction, users in VR can feel social discomfort if those who they're interacting with are violating normal real-world personal space. This may include the proximity of one avatar to another, the placement of motion-captured hands, arms, or legs close to the avatar's face, or even a high-speed approach and passing of one avatar through another.  2D users have to be aware that those in VR experience these sensations differently. If a user expresses discomfort with a particular behavior and the activity continues, this can be considered harassment and may result in account suspension or termination.

## Warning, Suspension, Banishment

The staff of Microsoft understands that there's a learning curve with VR and 2D virtual environments. We understand that some new users may inadvertently violate some of the less severe standards listed above. We ask that the community help us kindly teach others the nuances of existing in a virtual environment. We were all new to VR at one time. It's amazing how far calm and kind communication goes with people that are perceived as behaving badly. In cases where rational communication won't work, violations of the Community Standards will first result in a warning, followed by Suspension and eventual Termination of the AltspaceVR account. In-VR company representatives, called Concierges, may occasionally address disciplinary problems with a temporary removal from AltspaceVR. These individuals will have the AltspaceVR logo in their name tag.

## Alternate Accounts

While community members may choose to create and use more than one account, specifically or consistently using an alternate account to harass other users or violate the Community Standards isn't acceptable. Alternate accounts are treated as separate from a user's principal account, but misuse of alternate accounts can and will result in disciplinary action on the principal account.

## Reporting Violations of the Community Standards

If you feel an individual has breached the Community Standards, you may file an Abuse Report with the AltspaceVR Community Team. Please include an explanation of the incident, the account names of those involved and the time and time it transpired. The AltspaceVR Community Team will review the report and take the appropriate action. As a policy, we don't provide details of those actions to the reporter. Please don't follow up requesting the status of the decision.
