# Public beta build programs

Welcome! This article outlines the Public Beta Build Program. This initiative gives individuals interested in helping find and track bugs in pre-released build versions, an opportunity to do so. Additionally, content creators (Event Hosts/World Builders) who would like to compatibility-check their creations (events/worlds) before new releases, may also use the Public Beta Build Program to access early versions of forthcoming builds. Overall, the goals of the Public Beta Build Program are to: 

* Help event creators and world builders test things before updates go live.  
* Look for regressions between builds. 
* Help verify incoming fixes 
 
## How It Works: 

The Public Beta Build Program is available through both the Oculus Rift/Rift S and Oculus Quest/Quest 2 stores, and the Steam Library. This makes switching between Live and Beta builds simple and easy to self-manage. It also means participating in the Public Beta Build Program is entirely optional and at the discretion of each individual. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions:  

Steam library:

1. Open the Steam Library
2. Search for AltspaceVR
3. Right-click and select "properties"
4. Go to "BETAS" tab
5. Select "Beta-Release candidates" from the drop-down
6. You should leave the code portion blank
7. Select Close
8. You should now see "AltspaceVR[beta]" as the application name
9. Select Play to enter the beta build

Oculus store:

1. Log into your Oculus Account
2. Search for AltspaceVR
3. Scroll down through the "Additional details" section to find the "Version + Release Notes"
4. From the drop-down menu, select "RC: X.X.X.XXXXX"
5. Launch the AltspaceVR program to enter the beta build

## Notes: 

In the Steam Library, you can switch back to the Live Build version by following the same steps, but instead selecting "NONE - Opt out of all beta programs" for step # 5. 

In the Oculus Rift/Quest/Go store, you can switch back to the Live Build by following the same steps, but instead selecting “LIVE X.X.X.XXXXXXX” for step # 4. 

Remember that Beta opt-in is device-local through the Steam Library (will apply only to selected device), however opt-in through the Oculus Rift/Quest/Go store is global (will apply across all devices of the same category, like two Quests for example.) 

WE ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT USE EARLY BUILDS FOR REGULAR APP USE.  
This can cause compatibility issues that may impact your AltspaceVR experience and that of other individuals as well. It's good practice to confirm your build number regularly to ensure that you don't confuse Beta and Live builds. 

## Filing a Bug/Issue: 

One of the goals of the Public Beta Build Program is to find and log any bugs or issues that may arise between releases, and identify any potential regressions between versions.  

**Submit all bugs and issues found in any early build to us at [altvr.com/betabuild](altvr.com/betabuild)**

Additionally, remember to send logs anytime you come across a possible bug, regression, or issue. To submit logs go to the SETTINGS tab in your Main Menu, select SUPPORT, select SUBMIT LOGS. If you've experienced a crash, follow these steps but select SUBMIT LAST LOGS as your final step. 

In general, logs are extremely useful in helping us reproduce and verify any potential issues. 

## Getting Beta Builds: 

Much like regular builds, beta builds will become available to you through the app store or library of your preference. Beta builds will auto-install if you're actively opted in through the store/library. 

## Additional Information: 

* The Public Beta Build Program is an entirely optional initiative. Testing early builds isn't a requirement to using AltspaceVR. 
* You may choose to opt out at any time through your respective app store/library (Oculus or Steam).  
* AltspaceVR reserves the right to decide which forthcoming builds are eligible for the Public Beta Build Program. Not every build will be part of the Public Beta Build Program. 
* The prioritization order and solution-timelines for the tickets submitted to us through the Public Beta Build Program are at the sole discretion of the AltspaceVR development team.
