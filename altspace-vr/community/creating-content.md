# Creating AltspaceVR content

AltspaceVR is an excellent community for those who want to create and share VR content. 

## MRE (Mixed Reality Extension) SDK

We want to support and grow our community of developers. We've created several resources that we hope will assist even novice developers with creating 3D multi-user web apps and experiences. 

## Start creating

Visit our [AltspaceVR Developer Portal](https://developer.altvr.com/) to learn more about the MRE (Mixed Reality Extension) SDK.
