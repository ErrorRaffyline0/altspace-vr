# Creating AltspaceVR content

AltspaceVR is an excellent community for those who want to create and share VR content. We want to support and grow our community of developers. 

## MRE (Mixed Reality Extension) SDK

The MRE SDK is the new SDK for building AltspaceVR extensions using Node.JS. 

**To get started**:
1. Install AltspaceVR from Steam or the Oculus Store.
1. Create an AltspaceVR account, and then familiarize yourself with the AltspaceVR app.
1. Install [Git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
1. Go to the MRE SDK Samples repository and follow the step-by-step instructions to build and run a sample.

You can also:

-Join the [MRE SDK Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xyBcQec) to chat with other MRE developers.
-Watch the [Building Tic-Tac-Toe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHrdK9JSXI).
-Learn how to edit and build MREs with [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk#using-visual-studio-code).
-Browse the [Hello World](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples/tree/master/samples/hello-world) source code.

## Integrating the MRE SDK into your own app

If you have made your own app or game in Unity3D, and want to run MREs inside your app, you should look at the [MRE Unity Client Library repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-unity).

## World Editor

Inside AltspaceVR, you can use our built-in World Editor in your home space--this is the easiest way to modify your space. Using the World Editor, you can place 3D objects, teleporters and extensions (MREs) and change the world skybox.  To learn more, see [Getting Started With the World Editor](../world-building/world-editor-getting-started.md). 

If you join the [Early Access](../world-building/early-access.md) program, you'll also be able to create additional worlds on the [AltspaceVR My Worlds](https://account.altvr.com/worlds/my) page.

There's also a [wonderful video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILyD_fwfoo) that covers the end-to-end process of building worlds, including the website, the World Editor, and the Unity Uploader.

## Unity Uploader

We offer the Unity Uploader for both worlds and custom kits. To learn more, see [Introducing the AltspaceVR Uploader](.../world-building/world-building-toolkit-getting-started). You can also discuss it on the World Builders Discord channel--see the links under "Join the Community" below.

If you have legacy Unity 2018 kits or templates to update to Unity 2019.2, check out the [Upgrade Guide](https://developer.altvr.com/upgrade-2019-2/).
