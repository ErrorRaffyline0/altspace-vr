# Host tools overview

When you create an event you are the automatic Host of that event. The Host role grants you access to special features and abilities created specifically to make hosting a live virtual event simple and easy. Below is a detailed overview of these features and abilities, as well as additional helpful hints for hosting events in AltspaceVR.

## Understanding Host Tools

The host tools appear on the bottom right-hand side of your field-of-view. It is available to you immediately after your event has been created, so you can enter your event anytime (event start-time does not apply to the Host) and get comfortable with the tools before showtime. The Host Tools will give you quick-click access to things like muting and messaging your audience, toggling your stage blockers on and off, megaphoning yourself, allowing your guests to “raise their hands” to ask questions or offer feedback, and more.

### Toggle Mute All

By muting your attendees, you can limit distracting sounds and keep things nice and quiet in your space. The mute function will last for as long as a host allows, or when the host leaves the space. When an attendee enters the space or tries to unmute, attendees will receive an on-screen message letting them know they’ve been muted by the host. When the host unmutes, the attendees will receive a message letting them know that they are unmuted as well.

### Message All
Hosts can send a message to all the attendees present. Use any of our quick-notes or write an original one. Once sent, everyone will receive the message as a pop up.

### Amplify My Voice
Hosts can amplify their microphones to ensure that everyone in your event will hear what you are saying regardless of distance.

### Stage Blocking (On/Off)
Decide when and where attendees can stand. Choose to hog the spotlight, take turns presenting, or invite everyone on stage for a group dance party.

Disclaimer: Not all worlds contain a stage blocker, so pick your event templates wisely. Make yourself familiar with our event templates on test events prior to creating your official event.

## Host Panel

Clicking on the Host Panel button will open additional advanced options for your events.

### Guests Tab

The Guests Tab allows you to keep track of the guests, moderators, and hosts in your space. It is an interactive list that gives you a multi-page breakdown of who is in your event. Clicking on a guest gives you additional options (the hamburger menu) which lets you mute and megaphone by individual.

### Moderation Tools

As an Event Host you are responsible for managing the experience of others. To do this efficiently, you need robust moderation tools. As the Host of an event you can mute disruptive individuals, kick rule-breakers out of your event (temporarily or for the duration of your event) and even assign the Moderator role to others to get help managing the audience.

## Audience Participation Panel

The Participation Panel is designed to help you manage interaction and participation from your audience. Here you can toggle on the “Allow Hand Raises” option in order to unlock audience participation. In FrontRow events you'll need to be On-Air to activate this, otherwise this button will appear as greyed-out. When the “Allow Hand Raises” function is on, a “Raise Hand” button appears in the bottom right-hand section of your guests’ field-of-view. When a guest clicks this button, their First Name and Username pop up in your Participation Panel. From here you can call on them, megaphone them, mute them, dismiss them, and—if your event is a Front Row event — put them “On Air” to mirror them across multiple rooms. To help you keep track, the participation panel will even light up red when you have guests waiting to be called on, and it will let you know how long each of your guests have been waiting, too.
