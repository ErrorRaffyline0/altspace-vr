# Using the Groups Feature to Create Private Events

Our Groups Feature gives hosts the ability to create a VR space that is open to an approved list of guests. Hosts can manually add any AltspaceVR usernames/emails they’d like to grant access to their space. Here’s how you can use this feature to host events, meetings and conferences:

> [!NOTE]

1. On your browser, go to [https://altvr.com](https://altvr.com) and log into your account. 
2. Find the **“More”** pull-down menu.

> [!NOTE]
> You can hover over the green “?” to get additional information about the fields that have them.

7. Send an email to all attendees and have them create an AltspaceVR account using the same email address. They can either make an AltspaceVR account in-world or on our [website](https://account.altvr.com/users/sign_up).

## How to Create a Private Event From a Group

## How to use Patreon and Eventbrite to Host a Ticketed VR Event: 

You can use Patreon, Eventbrite to create ticketed events in Altspace. To do this, you will need to either create a list of your users’ e-mail addresses or export that information from your payment platform.  

### Creating a list

Utilize a spreadsheet program to create a single column with all the e-mail addresses. Once you have this, do the following:  

1. Create or edit your group.  
2. Find the “Member Emails” field.  
3. Find the “Choose File” option to import your emails from a *.csv file.
4. Your list should be imported with one email per line.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose, you can also copy and paste emails into the field instead of importing from a *.csv file.

### Importing a list

Platforms like Patreon and Eventbrite allow you to export a *.csv file (comma separated value) that has a dedicated “e-mail” column. You can select this column for use. Once you have this available, the steps are mostly the same, they are:  

1. Create or edit your group.  
2. Find the “Member Emails” field.  
3. Find the “Choose File” option to import your emails from a *.csv file.
4. Your list should be imported with one email per line.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose, you can also copy and paste emails into the field instead of importing from a *.csv file.

## FAQ 

### I’m having trouble filling out the fields in groups. What do they mean?

(*You can hover over the green “?” to get additional information about the fields that have them.) 

* **Name** – The name of the group that will be visible to all members.   
* **Description** – A field to describe the purpose of the group. Visible to all members.
* **Users** – This field allows you to list group members for the Group either as a username OR e-mail address as long as it is one per line. It is one way to define the group members. **However, for those utilizing external Payment Platforms like Patreon, please use the “Email Allow List” field described further down this page.**
    * Fill in a username or e-mail per line.  
    * To find a username in AltspaceVR, have the user open the “Main Menu” and go to the “Me” section. It is the name in parenthesis.  
    * To find the username on the website, have the user go “Profile” from the “More -> Profile” option. You can find it on the left column of the Profile page.  
    * The field is case sensitive so “username” and “Username” are considered different.  
    * This field accepts both usernames and e-mails associated with valid accounts. Make sure there is one item per line. You do not need to put both an e-mail or username if they are the same person, either will work.  
    * The accounts must be in good standing.  
    * The list can be searched with the find option of your browser “Ctrl + F”  
* **Image** – Used as the promotional banner image for the group. It is visible on the Group webpage and in VR.  
    * We recommend 1920 x1080 for better image fidelity.  
    * JPEG or PNG preferred.  
    * Images must be 16:9 aspect ratio.  
    * We autogenerate thumbnails from your upload and use them in various UI screens in AltspaceVR and the website.  
* **Profile Image** – Used as the groups profile image. It is visible on the Group webpage and in VR.  
    * We recommend 512×512 for better image fidelity.  
    * JPEG or PNG preferred.  
    * We autogenerate thumbnails from your upload and use them in various UI screens in AltspaceVR and the website.  
* **Select an Environment** – Located on the right side of the page, you will see various thumbnails of the available environments to use. This environment will act as your group’s primary hangout World and will appear in “Worlds -> My Worlds -> <Name from “Name” field> Commons” for you and your group members.  
    * If you want to create your own World, you must do it via [the Website](https://account.altvr.com/worlds/my), you will see those Worlds as possible options. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in Beta. We encourage groups to utilize preexisting Worlds in the Environment selection dialog.

    * The word “Commons” will always appear as a suffix to any group’s hangout world.  
* **Member Emails** – This field allows you to list users by the e-mail associated with an AltspaceVR account. **Using this list overrides the “Users” list described above.** This is the recommended way to manage membership of a group especially those utilizing external Payment Platforms.  
    * When filling out this field, make sure your AltspaceVR account associated e-mail is listed in it, or you may lose access to the group.  
    * When pasting addresses into his field, make sure there is one e-mail per line.  
    * This list accepts e-mails without a valid AltspaceVR account. AltspaceVR usernames get verified, e-mail addresses do not. However, when that e-mail is used to create an AltspaceVR account, then the user it is associated with will gain access to the Group.  
    * You have the option to import a list from a *.csv file. Select the “Choose File” option and select your file.
    * We recommend using Member Emails  as the way to manage groups being created from payment platforms such as Patreon or Eventbrite, as it is a more definitive way to reconcile your members. Note, Group Admins will need to inform their users/members that they must use the same EXACT e-mail address that they used on the payment platform to create an AltspaceVR account.  
    * Please see the Importing Users into Groups section to see instructions on how to get your list of users.   
* **Enable Auto Import** – Auto import is a recurring process run on the E-mail Allow List. It reconciles whether an e-mail now has a valid AltspaceVR account associated with it and grants access.   
    * We recommend that you enable it if you are using a csv file upload.
* **YouTube Video ID** – Allows you to embed a YouTube video onto the Group’s landing page on the website. Note, this is for the Group website only and does not appear inside AltspaceVR.
    * You must use the video id, not the full address. The video id is the set of characters that appear after the “=” (equal) sign on YouTube.  
* **Twitter Handle** – embed the latest tweets from a Twitter account onto your Group’s landing page on the website. Note, this is for the Group website only and does not appear inside AltspaceVR.
* **Create Group** – The button at the bottom of the page. When you have completed the fields described above, click this button to create your Group.
